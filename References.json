  {"id":"bawaChinaIndiaEnvironment2010","abstract":"China and India, the emerging economic giants of the world, will play a significant, perhaps a dominant, role in shaping the environmental outcomes for our planet in the 21st century. Both countries are expected to maintain an 8 to 9% rate of economic growth over the next several years (1). Even when much of the world is experiencing a recession, China and India in 2009 are projected to achieve high Gross Domestic Product growth (China, 8.4%; India, 6.2%; world, −2.2%) (1). Development in China and India is fueled not only by the natural capital within the countries, but also increasingly by imports of raw materials, particularly from southeast Asia. Both nations import ∼9 million tons of crude palm oil annually—almost one-quarter of global production—mostly from Malaysia and Indonesia (2). The degree to which China and India consume natural resources within their boundaries, and beyond, will largely determine future environmental, social, and economic outcomes. The two countries have been engaged in a border dispute that included a bitter, but brief, war in 1962. We propose that much more earnest cooperation between the world's two most populous countries will be vital for mitigating biodiversity loss, global warming, and deforestation.\nCooperation between China and India can curtail biodiversity loss, mitigate climate change, and reduce deforestation.\nCooperation between China and India can curtail biodiversity loss, mitigate climate change, and reduce deforestation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Bawa","given":"Kamaljit S."},{"family":"Koh","given":"Lian Pin"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Tien Ming"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Jianguo"},{"family":"Ramakrishnan","given":"P.

  {"id":"friedlingsteinGlobalCarbonBudget2020","abstract":"<p><strong class=\"journal-contentHeaderColor\">Abstract.</strong> Accurate assessment of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO<span class=\"inline-formula\"><sub>2</sub></span>) emissions and their redistribution among the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere in a changing climate – the “global carbon budget” – is important to better understand the global carbon cycle, support the development of climate policies, and project future climate change. Here we describe and synthesize data sets and methodology to quantify the five major components of the global carbon budget and their uncertainties. Fossil CO<span class=\"inline-formula\"><sub>2</sub></span> emissions (<span class=\"inline-formula\"><i>E</i><sub>FOS</sub></span>) are based on energy statistics and cement production data, while emissions from land-use change (<span class=\"inline-formula\"><i>E</i><sub>LUC</sub></span>), mainly deforestation, are based on land use and land-use change data and bookkeeping models. Atmospheric CO<span class=\"inline-formula\"><sub>2</sub></span> concentration is measured directly and its growth rate (<span class=\"inline-formula\"><i>G</i><sub>ATM</sub></span>) is computed from the annual changes in concentration. The ocean CO<span class=\"inline-formula\"><sub>2</sub></span> sink (<span class=\"inline-formula\"><i>S</i><sub>OCEAN</sub></span>) and terrestrial CO<span class=\"inline-formula\"><sub>2</sub></span> sink (<span class=\"inline-formula\"><i>S</i><sub>LAND</sub></span>) are estimated with global process models constrained by observations. The resulting carbon budget imbalance (<span class=\"inline-formula\"><i>B</i><sub>IM</sub></span>), the difference between the estimated total emissions and the estimated changes in the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere, is a measure of imperfect data and understanding of the contemporary carbon cycle.

Overall, the mean and trend in the components of the global carbon budget are consistently estimated over the period 1959–2019, but discrepancies of up to 1&thinsp;GtC&thinsp;yr<span class=\"inline-formula\"><sup>−1</sup></span> persist for the representation of semi-decadal variability in CO<span class=\"inline-formula\"><sub>2</sub></span> fluxes. Comparison of estimates from diverse approaches and observations shows (1) no consensus in the mean and trend in land-use change emissions over the last decade, (2) a persistent low agreement between the different methods on the magnitude of the land CO<span class=\"inline-formula\"><sub>2</sub></span> flux in the northern extra-tropics, and (3) an apparent discrepancy between the different methods for the ocean sink outside the tropics, particularly in the Southern Ocean.

  {"id":"urbanChinaRiseChallenging2018","abstract":"Historically, technology transfer from the global North to China played a large role in renewable energy pathways in China, particularly for wind energy, partly also for solar energy. Yet, the rise of China and other emerging economies means a shift away from a reliance on technology transfer and production capabilities to strengthening indigenous innovation capabilities. Drawing on evidence from the hydropower, solar and wind energy industry in China, the paper introduces the concept of ‘geographies of technology transfer and cooperation’ and challenges the North-South technology transfer and cooperation paradigm for low carbon innovation and climate change mitigation. The empirical evidence shows that for low carbon innovation, the conception that China is lacking behind in innovation capabilities is partly outdated. Instead, there is an increase in indigenous innovation capabilities, resulting in South-South technology transfer and cooperation as well as elements of ‘reverse’ South-North technology cooperation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Urban","given":"Frauke"}],"container-title":"Energy Policy","container-title-short":"Energy Policy","DOI":"10.1016/j.enpol.2017.11.007","ISSN":"0301-4215","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"320-330","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"China's rise: Challenging the North-South technology transfer paradigm for climate change mitigation and low carbon energy","title-short":"China's rise","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421517307450","volume":"113"},

  {"id":"wangEconomicGrowthEmission2018","abstract":"The contradiction between economic growth and carbon emissions in China and India is the most prominent in the world. Both countries have faced tremendous pressures to curb carbon emissions, because they are major source of new added emission sources. Meanwhile, both countries have faced greater pressures to achieve industrialization and urbanization in order to eradicate poverty. Better understanding the decoupling status and its drivers can serve to develop effective policy to achieve economic growth without an increase in emission. This paper comparatively analyses the decoupling effect of the economic growth from the carbon emissions as well as its drivers during the period 1980–2014 in China and India. The Tapio decoupling model was used to analyze the decoupling status, and the co-integration theory and the impulse response functions were applied to investigate the effects of urbanization, industrialization, per capita GDP and carbon emission intensity to decoupling. The results show that China mainly performed a weak decoupling of economic growth from carbon emissions in 1980–2014, while the decoupling status of India was no regular. In China, carbon emission intensity is the biggest contributor of decoupling, followed by urbanization, per capita GDP, and industrialization. In India, the biggest driver of decoupling is also the carbon emission intensity, followed by urbanization, industrialization, and per capita GDP. Therefore, improving energy efficiency is the best policy to toward economic growth without emission growth in China and India.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Qiang"},{"family":"Su","given":"Min"},{"family":"Li","given":"Rongrong"}],"container-title":"Journal of Cleaner Production","container-title-short":"Journal of Cleaner Production","DOI":"10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.09.034","ISSN":"0959-6526","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,12,20]]},"language":"en","page":"499-511","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Toward to economic growth without emission growth: The role of urbanization and industrialization in China and India","title-short":"Toward to economic growth without emission growth","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095965261832746X","volume":"205"}
