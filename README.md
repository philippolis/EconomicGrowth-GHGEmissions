# Economic Growth and Greenhouse Gas Emissions in Early vs Newly Industrialized Countries

Typically in the global North, worried thoughts go out to more populous and quickly growing economies such as China and India, who are the “emerging economic giants of the world, [and] will play a significant, perhaps dominant, role in shaping the environmental outcomes for our planet in the 21st century.” (Bawa et al. 2010)

This [analysis](https://github.com/philippolis/EconomicGrowth-GHGEmissions/blob/main/Analysis.pdf) visualises statistical data related to the topic in order to investigate whether worries regarding the environmental impact of large emerging economies are justified, how they might be put into perspective, and what possible ways out of the climate effects of economic growth might look like.
